The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.
In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.
Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^hw-08-exploring-gss-1]


## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.

You will need to install the packages and to install dsbox copy the following code into the console: 

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dsbox")
```

You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
library(openintro)
library(flextable)
library(parsnip)
library(tidymodels)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `gss16`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?gss16` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `gss16`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/gss16.html).

# Exercises

## Part 1: Harassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.
The question is phrased as the following.

> *Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?*

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

1.  What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents chose each of these answers?

***The respondents can respond with "Yes," "No" "Does not apply (i do not have a job/superior/co-worker)," and `NA`. 96 people said "Does not apply (i do not have a job/superior/co-worker)," 1136 people said "No," 237 people said "Yes," and 1398 people did not reply.***

```{r} 
gss16 %>%
  count(harass5)
```

2.  What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable\
    (i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.

***17.3% of the respondents have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.***

```{r}
applicable_answers <- gss16 %>%
  filter(harass5 %in% c("Yes", "No")) 

response_counts = applicable_answers %>%
  count(harass5)
response_counts$n / sum(response_counts$n) * 100
response_counts$harass5
```

## Part 2: Time spent on email

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on email weekly.
The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables.
For example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.

3.  Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
```{r}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(email = as.numeric((emailhr*60)+emailmin))
```

4.  Visualize the distribution of this new variable.
    Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly.
    Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly?
    Why?
    
```{r}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email)) +
  geom_histogram()

gss16 %>%
  summarise(means = mean(email, na.rm = TRUE), medians = median(email, na.rm = TRUE))
```
***The mean of the time spent on the emails is 416.8 minutes. The median is 120 minutes. I feel like the median is a better measure than the mean because it is a full and exact number rather than a number that lasts forever.***

5.  Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as "Yes" if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and "No" if not.
    If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.

```{r}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(snap_insta = snapchat, snap_insta = instagrm)
```

6.  Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.

***30.8% responders answered Yes.***
```{r}
snap_insta_applicable_answers <- gss16 %>%
  filter(snap_insta %in% c("Yes", "No")) 

response_counts = snap_insta_applicable_answers %>%
  count(snap_insta)
response_counts$n / sum(response_counts$n) * 100
response_counts$snap_insta
```

7.  What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents chose each of these answers?
    Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` variable.
```{r} 
gss16 %>%
  count(wrkstat)
```
***The possible responses for this question are "Keeping house" by 284 respondents, "Other" by 89 respondents, "Retired" by 574 respondents, "School" by 76 respondents, "Temp not working" by 57 respondents, "Unempl, laid off" by 118 respondents, "Working fulltime" by 1321 respondents, "Working parttime" by 345 respondents, and 3 people didn't respond.***

8.  Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`.
    Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.
```{r}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(gss16 == if_else(snap_insta == TRUE, "1", "0"))
```
```{r}
 email_educ_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email~educ, data = gss16) %>%
  tidy()


email_educ_fit %>% flextable()


```
***The linear for `email` and `educ` is:***
$$\widehat{email} = -219.5 + 45.3\times educ$$
***The average amount of time spent on emails is -219.5 minutes. The average years of education is 45.3 years higher than the average amount of time spent on emails.***
```{r}
 email_wrkstat_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email~wrkstat, data = gss16) %>%
  tidy()


email_wrkstat_fit %>% flextable()


```
***The linear for `email` and `wrkstat` is:***
$$\widehat{email} = 172.6 + 152.3\times wrkstatOther + 37.3\times wrkstatRetired +1.0\times wrkstatSchool +151.8\times wrkstatTemp not working + 161.9\times wrkstatUnempl, laid off + 415.5\times wrkstatWorking fulltime + 124.2\times wrkstatWorking parttime$$
***The average amount of time spent on emails is 172.6 minutes. The average number of other working respondents is 152.3 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of retired respondents is 37.3 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of working respondents in school is 1.0 respondent higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of respondents not working is 151.8 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of unemployed or laid off respondents is 161.9 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of respondents working full time is 415.5 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails. The average number of respondents working part time is 124.2 respondents higher than the average amount of time spent on emails.***

```{r}
 email_snap_insta_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email~snap_insta, data = gss16) %>%
  tidy()


email_snap_insta_fit %>% flextable()


```
***The linear for `email` and `snap_insta` is:***
$$\widehat{email} = 417.7 + 81.2\times snap_instaYes$$
***The average amount of time spent on emails is 417.7 minutes. The average number of Snapchat or Instagram users who answered Yes is 81.2 years higher than the average amount of time spent on emails.***
9.  Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model.
    Are there any issues with the model?
    If yes, describe them.
```{r}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email, y = educ))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE, color = "#FF00FF") +
  xlab("Average Minutes on Emails") +
  ylab("Average Years of Education") +
  ggtitle("Average Minutes on Emails vs. Average Years of Education")
```
***There seems to be nothing wrong with the scatterplot.***
```{r}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email, y = wrkstat))+
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Average Minutes on Emails") +
  ylab("Work Status") +
  ggtitle("Average Minutes on Emails vs. Work Status")
```
***the only problem with this plot is that I can't use a linear model on this.***
```{r}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email, y = snap_insta))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Average Minutes on Emails") +
  ylab("Snapchat/Instagram User Reply") +
  ggtitle("Average Minutes on Emails vs. Snapchat/Instagram User Reply")
```
***The problem with this plot is that I also can't use a linear model here.***

## Part 3: Political views and science research

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents whether they think of themselves as liberal or conservative (`polviews`) and whether they think science research is necessary and should be supported by the federal government (`advfront`).

-   The question on science research is worded as follows:

> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

And possible responses to this question are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, No answer, Not applicable.

-   The question on political views is worded as follows:

> We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
> I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal--point 1--to extremely conservative--point 7.
> Where would you place yourself on this scale?


**Note:** The levels of this variables are spelled inconsistently: "Extremely liberal" vs. "Extrmly conservative". Since this is the spelling that shows up in the data, you need to make sure this is how you spell the levels in your code.


And possible responses to this question are Extremely liberal, Liberal, Slightly liberal, Moderate, Slghtly conservative, Conservative, Extrmly conservative.
Responses that were originally Don't know, No answer and Not applicable are already mapped to `NA`s upon data import.

10. In a new variable, recode `advfront` such that Strongly Agree and Agree are mapped to `"Yes"`, and Disagree and Strongly disagree are mapped to `"No"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Don't overwrite the existing `advfront`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.
```{r}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(scirsch_advfront = if_else(advfront%in%c("Strongly agree", "Agree"), "Yes", if_else(advfront%in%c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree"), "No", advfront)))
```

11. In a new variable, recode `polviews` such that Extremely liberal, Liberal, and Slightly liberal, are mapped to `"Liberal"`, and Slghtly conservative, Conservative, and Extrmly conservative disagree are mapped to `"Conservative"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Make sure that the levels are in a reasonable order.
    Don't overwrite the existing `polviews`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.
```{r}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(lib_or_cons = if_else(polviews%in%c("Extremely liberal", "Liberal", "Slightly liberal"), "Liberal", if_else(polviews%in%c("Extrmly conservative", "Conservative", "Slghtly conservative"), "Concervative", polviews)))
```
12. Create a visualization that displays the relationship between these two new variables and interpret it.
```{r}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = scirsch_advfront, fill = lib_or_cons))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  xlab("Replies of Advancing Frontiers") +
  ylab("Number of Respondents per Reply") +
  ggtitle("Replies of Advancing Frontiers vs. Number of Respondents per Reply based on Political Views") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Political Views"))
```

***It seems that most conservatives and less liberals answered "Don't know" when asked about advancing the frontier and most moderates and less conservatives answered "Yes."***
